But another change brought about by the naked eye is that the quality of videos and live broadcasts of VTuber has become more mixed.<br><br>To me, most of the things that happened before are meaningless when put into the present.<br><br>However, this event is different, not only changed my fate, changed the whole two dimension, and even changed the whole world.<br><br>Yes, you heard it right, Shinka Musume is back.<br><br>But not Xinke Animation. To me, it is indeed a miracle that a channel that has been stopped airing, a project that has been disbanded, and an operation that has little management experience has survived this long in this day and age.<br><br>There may be many who say that I still have illusions about Shinka Musume and don't want to accept the fact that Shinka Musume left, which is why I think Shinka Musume has come back.<br><br>But this is not my fantasy, because I am just an ordinary person, I do not have the ability and cannot "resurrect" a "vanguard" that has fallen.<br><br>Of course, if I wasn't willing to accept the fact that Shinka Musume graduated, then why did I come out of those shadows? Why would I criticize what Xinke Animation did afterwards?<br><br>On the contrary, I also did not believe at all in the beginning that Shinka Musume returned, and it was only when the world told me personally with the change of things that I gradually understood that so much had happened at that time.<br><br>Yes, Xinke Animation may have been disbanded, and at this point in time, Xin Ke has long since left the team, but she is working with everyone to create endless possibilities.<br><br>Although I have criticized Xinke Animation, at the same time, I would like to thank them for pushing the development of Chinese two dimension and bringing Chinese animation to a new era. Even though Xinke Animation is gone, Chinese animation will continue to grow and create more beauty with us.<br><br>And the factor that made me decide to make this video was at the beginning of May 2022.<br><br>After the graduation of Carol, a member of the virtual club A-SOUL, I gradually thought of the former Shinka Musume and Kizuna AI, and subsequently became suspicious of the world.<br><br>We are in a chaotic and confusing world. Trade disputes are intensifying, the Russo-Ukrainian War continues to this day, and the COVID-19 epidemic sweeping the world enters its third year...<br><br>What is wrong with the world? How do I make sense of the world, and of myself as I live in it? More and more people are starting to think about these questions.<br><br>Looking at the present, it seems that only China is still actively embracing globalization and promoting the community with a shared future for mankind.<br><br>Perhaps... virtual circle of everyone, because of the previous preferences and different atmosphere and a gap, but the atmosphere is different can really affect whether we can pursue happiness together?<br><br>No, because everyone's heart is actually good, everyone's original intention has not changed, are for virtual this existence and get together. Whether it's A-SOUL, Hololive, Nijisanji, VirtuaReal, Overidea or any other association or individual potential, I believe that we can all live together in harmony.<br><br>If someone says that these are impossible to achieve, then... I'll uncover the wounds again?<br><br>The game was supposed to be something that allowed people to have fun, but at some point it became a hate mongering tool. Although the latter words will be difficult for many people to understand, but I think these mindless siege almost have to.<br><br>Whether it is Genshin players, Arknights players, or Tower of Fantasy players, Honkai players, Azur Lane players and Minecraft players, we can actually all get together in a friendly manner.<br><br>Although the dispute between the parties still exists at present, but the disappearance of the differences is just a matter of time.<br><br>If someone says that these wishes are impossible to achieve, it is that he only sees those things that are destined to be eliminated by history.<br><br>Many people only saw the superficial bickering, but did not know that some people had been driven mad by the vitriol.<br><br>There are many mean people who abuse and laugh at those crazy people as they crash like wild animals against those high walls of estrangement.<br><br>But why don't those mean people blame the hate-makers?<br><br>Because they are cold and heartless, they bully the weak, they dare not look the hate-makers in the eye, but choose to bully those who have gone crazy people with vitriol.<br><br>But can this last for long?<br><br>It can't.<br><br>When the conflict accumulates to a certain level, this pressure is bound to explode.<br><br>The haters and the mean-spirited, they think that by blocking people's mouths, things don't happen, they think that by blocking the flood, the flood won't rise again.<br><br>But the result, often more violent. <br><br>Those haters and mean people didn't think that they had pissed off a lot of people that they shouldn't have pissed off.<br><br>As time changes, more and more people gradually see the evil deeds of the haters and join the ranks of the crazy peoples.<br><br>They may be doctors, engineers, workers in reality, or couriers, office workers, students.<br><br>Some people are busy all day and want to watch a live stream, watch a virtual, play a game or whatever, in fact, they just want to get a little bit of healing and happiness.<br><br>But they are actually ordinary, ordinary people, just like us.<br><br>And those haters and mean-spirited people can't hear the hearts and cries of those crazy people.<br><br>"I'm not even fucking afraid of death, what am I afraid of?!"<br><br>Maybe that wall of separation suited the previous environment, but now there is no need for it to continue to exist.<br><br>Those crazy people would rather turn into beasts and smash through those estrangement walls just so that more people can feel the sunlight they fought for.<br><br>Those crazy people would rather endure the pain and challenge the haters just to make the world a better place to live.<br><br>Although those haters can withstand one or two crazy people, can they withstand thousands of crazy people? Can they stand up to the crazy people who are united and unafraid of difficulties? Can they resist the crazy people who love the mountains and the earth, who love poetry and faraway places, who love hope and beauty?<br><br>They cannot.<br><br>The world is so convoluted that the haters fail to see their own incompetence, and they all end up being turned back by the hate they create.<br><br>At the same time, I see the estrangement walls coming down and see the point of the crazy people doing this.<br><br>They are proving by their actions that anything is possible.<br><br>"It's time for everyone to talk to each other."<br><br>By chance, I saw a microcosm of history in those crazy people.<br><br>In China, the 1998 floods, as well as the 2008 winter storms, the Wenchuan earthquake, and the Global Financial Crisis... <br><br>Nevertheless, these difficulties have not defeated the Chinese people who have gone through hardships, it also successfully hosted the Beijing Olympic that shocked the world.<br><br>"We Chinese people have a strong cohesive force, no difficulty can overwhelm us, the Chinese people are invincible!"<br><br>Change is coming, hope is on the horizon, and everyone is gradually beginning to unite, and those that cannot defeat them will surely make them stronger.<br><br>If someone says Shinka Musume is no more, it's just that they don't want to face the reality.<br><br>In their eyes, Shinka Musume is just a VTuber who has graduated, and no one will know her anymore.<br><br>But Xin Ke, does not only belong to the virtual circle, also belongs to the two dimension, but also belongs to this world of all of us.<br><br>After all, "you can't move forward if you're stuck in the past".<br><br>But I am not a trapped beast of time. I know I have experienced a lot of pain in the past, and I understand that I can no longer go back to the good that I once had, so I will try to cut off as much regret as possible for the future.<br><br>Therefore, I want to explore and discover the journey and the future of Shinka Musume in my own way.<br><br>By the way, if there is still a chance to meet that little flying squirrel in the future, I would like to share all these stories with her...<br><br>And this year also happens to be the 100th anniversary of Chinese animation.<br><br>All rivers run into sea, tolerance is a virtue. As a long-standing, profound Chinese culture, in the future will certainly leave a strong and colorful stroke.<br><br>And now, Xin Ke has returned to our side.<br><br>Then, the era of great integration and inclusion will be opened by me, Xin Ke, and everyone else in this era!<br><br>"Together with young culture, we will build infinite possibilities."
